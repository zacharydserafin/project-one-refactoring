# University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp: Project One - Refactoring

*Challenge 01 - Utilizing skills we learned in "Module 1: HTML, CSS, and Git"*

## Description

The goal of Project (or Challenge) One was to refactor a website and add semantic tags to the index.html file. I was given the source code for the webpage, where most code blocks were tagged using "div", and needed to be replaced with tags like "header", "footer", and "main", among others. I was instructed not to change anything about the layout or style of the webpage, only clean up the HTML.
